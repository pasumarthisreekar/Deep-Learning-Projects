A few experiments I ran during my summer internship.

Used dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, Kernel PCA and Autoencoders to reduce the dimensionality of high feature-to-sample ratio datasets

Improved the classification accuracy of deep neural networks using such methods by about 10-15%
